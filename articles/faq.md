# FAQ

Below you'll find a list of frequently asked questions, some of which are acceptable, and some of which go against the phrase "there are no stupid questions".

## Does this bot play music?
No, and it will never be added.

## How do I set up Twitter / Twitch / Picarto / RSS?
See [Notifications](notifications.md)

## The admin panel isn't loading.
Verify you aren't running any extensions that are blocking scripts / network calls, e.g. Privacy Badger.

## Can I self host the bot?
UB3R-B0T's core bot client code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/moiph/ub3r-b0t). However, portions of the bot are offloaded to separate services so self hosting just the bot will not include most of the commands. It's also not well documented from a dev perspective but you're welcome to explore... :)

## How do I find my server ID?
If the bot is in your server and responding, you can use the `debug` command.
Otherwise: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/178208468124172288/448708933264343040/unknown.png

## Why doesn't this command work? Why isn't the bot responding?
Verify the bot's permissions and roles.  Start with `debug` and make sure that works to verify both read and send permissions.  Make sure you haven't disabled a feature/command in the admin panel.

See the [Commands](commands.md) section for full details.

## I'm getting an error about "shared search limits"
Some commands may return an error message about "Shared search limit reached for the day. Provide your own API key in the admin panel to maintain limits for your own server". These talk to external APIs which require application keys. The default ones used by UB3R-B0T hit their limits very quickly. You need to go to the admin panel and follow the instructions in the commands section to add your own keys.
