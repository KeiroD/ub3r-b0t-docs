# Intro

UB3R-B0T is primarily a utility bot. He's also a bit grumpy because he's a 13 year old IRC bot and will show it in some of his responses. But with age, comes wisdom. Maybe. 

## Commands

Find the full reference sheet of support commands here: [The commands](commands.md)

## Conguration

Once UB3R-B0T has been added to your server, there are a number of ways you can configure the bot to suit your server.
