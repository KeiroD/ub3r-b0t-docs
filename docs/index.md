# The hell is an UB3R-B0T?

UB3R-B0T is primarily a utility bot. He's also a bit grumpy because he's a 13 year old IRC bot and will show it in some of his responses. But with age, comes wisdom. Maybe.


## Adding UB3R-B0T to your server

### On Discord
Oh man this is the easiest part you literally just click this [Invite link](https://ub3r-b0t.com/invite) and he'll join your server once you authorize it.

### On IRC or Twitch
Okay well this part isn't self service you have to go ping moiph on Discord and request this one.

**Note**: This is not an IRC/Discord relay bot. It's standalone per platform.


## The Commands

There are quite a few commands. Some are legitimately useful (like reminders). Some are useless (like the votekick command). Some are fun (like the beer command).

Find the full reference of commands here: [The commands](commands.md)


## Conguration

Once UB3R-B0T has been added to your server, there are a number of ways you can configure the bot to suit your server.
You can:
- Disable certain commands you dislike. Like the Chuck Norris command because it's dated or the FML command because it's been broken for years?
- Set greetings/farewells for when users join/leave
- Disable silly auto responses
- Add your OWN silly auto responses
- Customize the command prefix (ugh no stahp default maintains consistency)
- Setup word censors
- Look at a page of quotes that you can't act upon because I'm a lazy ass and haven't finished the quote management portal
- Configure Notifications (see below)


## Notifications

UB3R-B0T supports notifications from various sources:
- Mixer
- Twitch
- Twitter
- Picarto
- RSS

Configuration of each type can be done in the [Admin panel](https://ub3r-b0t.com/admin)


## FAQ

You can find a list of frequently asked questions here: [FAQ](faq.md)


## Patreon

Ugh I hate upselling but if you wanna join the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ub3rb0t) thing you get perks like higher limits on notification types and you can feel special.


## Reporting issues

You can use the `.feedback` command for general feedback or suggestions. For more technical issues you can file something on the main project page: [https://github.com/moiph/ub3r-b0t](https://github.com/moiph/ub3r-b0t)
You can also swing by the [UB3R-B0T Discord server](https://discord.gg/0t6waxpRf4xvyNHj) and ask questions in the #bot-questions channel (or whichever one is most appropriate)
Prove you at least read some of the documentation by saying "A Møøse once bit my sister"
We'll be nicer knowing you manged to read.
